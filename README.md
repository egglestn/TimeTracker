# README

TimeTracker and https://github.com/egglestn/TimeTrackerUI are investment projects

Intentions:
* learn a bit more about Json API for rails
* learn about integrating google ids with an app

Investment projects are timeboxed so the code and UI may not be pretty: the primary intention is to learn quickly.

TimeTracker is JSON-only server, intended for use with a separate UI client, so it won't look like much on its own - curl experts are welcome to browse

TODO

* Change entries table to support date fields
* User id token management
* Validate user is a member of the alliants.com group
  - via google
  - or for simplicity just parse the email address?
* User management??
